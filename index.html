        <h2>Remembering a Legend</h2>
        <p>
          ☛ Srila Prabhupada is the Founder-Acharya of International Society for
          Krishna Consciousness <b>(ISKCON)</b> which brought a spiritual
          dimension to the lives of thousands of his followers. <br /><br />

          his life to spreading God consciousness all over the world.
          <br /><br />
          ☛ Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contributions, perhaps, are his
          books. He authored over 70 volumes on the Krishna tradition, which are
          highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth, fidelity to
          the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works are used as textbooks
          in numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into 76
          languages.<br /><br />
          ☛ His most prominent works include: <b>Bhagavad-gita As It Is</b>, the
          30-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the 17-volume Sri
          Caitanya-caritamrita. <br /><br />
          ☛ Under his inspiration, Krishna devotees established ic_temples,
          rural communities, educational institutions, and started what would
          become the world’s largest vegetarian food relief program.

        <h1>ISKCON - The International Society for Krishna Consciousness</h1>
        <hr />

          <span>"</span>
          The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is a
          branch of the monotheistic Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition within Hinduism
          dating back 5000 years to Lord Krishna Himself. ISKCON was established
          in the West in 1966 by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
          Prabhupada (Srila Prabhupada) and has since developed into a worldwide
          confederation of over 500 temples, centers, communities, schools, and
          restaurants with some 250,000 devotees.
          <span>"</span>

        <p>
          <span>"</span>
          The mission of this nonsectarian, monotheistic movement is to promote
          the well-being of society by teaching the science of Krishna
          consciousness according to <span>Bhagavad-gita</span> and other
          ancient scriptures.
